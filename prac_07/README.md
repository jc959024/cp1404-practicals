CP1404 Module 7: Classes and OOP 2

About Me:
I am Zhong Huayu, a student currently studying the CP1404 subject, which is centered around the principles of clean code and object-oriented programming. My goal is to enhance my coding skills and apply best practices in software development.

Lessons Learned About Clean Code:
1.Use Introspection Properly: Instead of comparing types directly, use isinstance() for type comparisons as recommended by PEP8. This ensures code clarity and correctness.
2.Operator Overloading: Python allows overloading of operators for custom types, which helps in making the code more intuitive and readable.
3.Avoid Unbound Syntax: Prefer bound method calls (e.g., str.upper()) over unbound syntax (e.g., str.upper("string")) to maintain code simplicity and consistency.
